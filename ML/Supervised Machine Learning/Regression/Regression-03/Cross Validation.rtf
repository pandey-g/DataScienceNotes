\f0\fs24 \cf0 Here we look at cross validation (CV) \'97> basically used for hyper parameter tuning.\
\
\'97> Here We can use sklearn.linear_model.LassoCV\
\
Here we basically divide our training data set into two parts\
	1) Training Data Set\
	2) Validation Data Set\
\
\'97> let\'92 suppose we have 1000 datapoints in our dataset then : if cv = 5.\
\'97> here we basically have something called cv = 5\
\'97> As cv= 5 we get 5 accurecies \
\
\'97>1) we\'92ll divide 1000 data points into 5 groups each containing 200 data points \
In first iteration we use 200 datapoints as validation dataset and 800 as training dataset\
In second iteration  we use 400 datapoints as validation dataset and 600 as training  dataset\
In third iteration  we use 600 datapoints as validation datasets and 400 as training datasets\
In fourth iteration we use 800 datapoints as validation datasets and 200 as training datasets\

\
\'97> Multi Collinearity  means that two or more features are highly correlated (may be +ve or -ve)\
	\'97> In such cases let\'92s say that two features are highly correlated with correlation of 95% then we say that both columns are similar and drop one of these columns\
	\'97> Now this correlation factor in choose by domain experts .}
